## MFSE: A Meta-Fusion Model for Polypharmacy Side-Effect Prediction with Graph Neural Networks

MFSE introduces a novel framework for the task of multi-relational link prediction with graph neural networks. Given a multi-relational graph, relation-specific vector representations are created for each node of the graph. With this approach, MFSE creates drug vector representations that are side-effect specific, by integrating external molecular and protein-target information with the drug information that is generated directly from the drug-drug interaction prediction graph.

MFSE was presented in The 34th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI). It will be published in IEEE Xplore in December 2022.

###Source Code

MFSE is developed with PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric and PyTorch Lightning. Details about installation and requirements will be uploaded shortly.
